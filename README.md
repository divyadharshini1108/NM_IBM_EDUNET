Description :
This repository contains a character recognition system implemented in Python using machine learning techniques. Character recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision and natural language processing, with applications ranging from handwritten text recognition to license plate recognition.
Introduction : 
Character recognition, also known as optical character recognition (OCR), is the process of converting images of typed, handwritten, or printed text into machine-encoded text. This repository provides a Python implementation of a character recognition system that utilizes machine learning algorithms to accurately identify and classify characters from images.

The system employs various techniques from computer vision and machine learning, including image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. It can recognize characters from different fonts, styles, and orientations, making it versatile for a wide range of applications.
